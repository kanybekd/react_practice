      "React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[4][5] for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[6][7][8] React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.[9][10] A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.

      "Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only.[4] Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.[12] Vue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives.[13] The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives.

      "AngularJS is a discontinued free and open-source JavaScript-based web framework for developing single-page applications. It was maintained mainly by Google and a community of individuals and corporations. It aimed to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in web applications and progressive web applications. AngularJS was used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, that consisted of MongoDB database, Express.js web application server framework, AngularJS itself (or Angular), and Node.js server runtime environment. As of January 1, 2022, Google no longer updates AngularJS to fix security, browser compatibility, or jQuery issues.[3][4][5] The Angular team recommends upgrading to Angular (v2+) as the best path forward, but they also provided some other options.[6]",

      "Svelte is a free and open-source component-based front-end software framework,[2] and language[3] created by Rich Harris and maintained by the Svelte core team members.[4] Svelte is not a monolithic JavaScript library imported by applications: instead, Svelte compiles HTML templates to specialized code that manipulates the DOM directly, which may reduce the size of transferred files and give better client performance.[5] Application code is also processed by the compiler, inserting calls to automatically recompute data[2] and re-render UI elements when the data they depend on is modified.[6] This also avoids the overhead associated with runtime intermediate representations, such as virtual DOM,[7] unlike traditional frameworks (such as React and Vue) which carry out the bulk of their work at runtime, i.e. in the browser.[5][6][4][8][2][7] The compiler itself is written in JavaScript.[9][8] Its source code is licensed under MIT License and hosted on GitHub.[8] Among comparable frontend libraries, Svelte has one of the smallest bundle footprints at merely 2KB.[10]",
